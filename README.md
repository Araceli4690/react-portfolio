# React Portfolio
This is a single-page application portfolio displaying my recent web-development projects. When viewers load the portfolio they are presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. The header contains an about me section, a contact section, a portfolio section, and a resume section. When viewers click on any of the navigation titles then they are redirected to the according section. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
